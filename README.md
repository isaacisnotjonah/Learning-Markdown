Bulleted list

Here are some bullet points:

* Just start each line with the following
* A star (*)
  * Put 2 spaces before the star to indent once.
    * Put 4 spaces before the star to indent twice.
        * Put 6 spaces before the star to indent once.
And so on.  
This also works for numbered lists.
